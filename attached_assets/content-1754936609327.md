OpenAI offers ChatGPT, an advanced general intelligence (AGI) chatbot which interacts in a conversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests. ChatGPT is a sibling model to InstructGPT, which is trained to follow an instruction in a prompt and provide a detailed response.

In 2023 OpenAI launched ChatGPT Enterprise, which offers enterprise-grade security and privacy, unlimited higher-speed GPT‑4 access, longer context windows for processing longer inputs, advanced data analysis capabilities, and other customization options.

Enterprise features:

- Connect to company data - Uses built-in connectors—or buildable connectors—to bring knowledge into ChatGPT from Microsoft SharePoint, GitHub, Google Drive, or Box.
- Use agents with a single prompt - Delegate coding tasks to Codex and save hours with deep research, which synthesizes internal and web sources into analyst-level reports.
- Complete tasks - ChatGPT helps teams get work done—whether it’s creating content, analyzing data, or writing code.

##### [Use Cases and Deployment Scope](https://www.trustradius.com/products/chatgpt/reviews?qs=product-usage\#reviews)

We use ChatGPT in a myriad of ways, but mostly to quickly generate content about various topics in the animal world for marketing purposes. The content that comes over is usually about 90% relevant, with us having to change some of the lingo, as well as interject bits of our own. We find that ChatGPT mostly helps speed up mundane processes, allowing us more time to work on the creatives itself.

##### [Pros](https://www.trustradius.com/products/chatgpt/reviews?qs=pros-and-cons\#reviews)

- Saves time by generating content about a specific topic very quickly

- Allows us to quickly learn information online (from various sources or even a single lengthy article) into more summed up digestible paragraphs (and even bullet points)

- Can autogenerate content on a vast amount of topics


##### Cons

- We have found topics where ChatGPT is either wrong or can't figure out altogether

- We have to rewrite ChatGPT's text to ensure Google's algorithm doesn't ding our website's score

- ChatGPT has limited integrations with certain software systems that we use on a daily basis


##### [Likelihood to Recommend](https://www.trustradius.com/products/chatgpt/reviews?qs=likelihood-to-recommend\#reviews)

ChatGPT really excels at speeding up mundane processes, such as online research, freeing up a ton of employee time. It also spits that information out into easily digestible content, allowing you to not only learn quickly about the topic, but use it's content in creative processes for marketing. It's been a game changer for us since we started using it.

##### [Use Cases and Deployment Scope](https://www.trustradius.com/products/chatgpt/reviews?qs=product-usage\#reviews)

I use ChatGPT for writing (summarise and paraphrase content, make the content tone more professional etc), email writing (professional context driven email drafting), pdf reading (analysing pdfs and Q&As around it), using web-search and deep research capabilities of ChatGPT. The chatbot helps me with professional writing, insights generation and web & deep research functionalities. It assists me in research around technologies, markets, industry and macro-economical analysis.

Overall, It helps me improving my productivity and by providing me with first base draft of intelligent data backed reports on which i build my research insights. Additionally, because of ChatGPT my reports completion time also significantly reduced driven by precise prompting and quicker responses with the tool.

With ChatGPT, my use cases are various like researching and analysing companies, industries, markets, building newsletters etc

##### [Pros](https://www.trustradius.com/products/chatgpt/reviews?qs=pros-and-cons\#reviews)

- Writing, summarising, changing language tone, expanding or reducing the size of content

- Web research and deep research

- Coding for personalised app development

- PDF reading and analysing the content


##### Cons

- Needs improvements around content hallucination (it cant say no to users and hence sometimes it makes own answers)

- Needs improvement around statistical analysis (sometime it hallucinates with numbers)

- Web search misses various important info while crawling the web. If this can be fixed it will have great use case around AI web research

- When uploaded any pdf, often it overlooks some of the info in the uploaded pdf, which is visible in Q&A responses from ChatGPT


##### [Likelihood to Recommend](https://www.trustradius.com/products/chatgpt/reviews?qs=likelihood-to-recommend\#reviews)

Despite some challenges, it enormously increases users productivity, shifting you from creator to reviewer

ChatGPT is suited in writing contents, drafting professional emails. It is very handy in brainstorming ideas and strategies.

While it is not advisable os suited for things like give a real-time data and financial clearance where critical accuracy is required.

It also do not replace human creativity because it takes human to tweak it to give the right answer.

##### [Use Cases and Deployment Scope](https://www.trustradius.com/products/chatgpt/reviews?qs=product-usage\#reviews)

ChatGPT is a potent tool, both personally and professionally, as long as you know how to use it effectively.



It’s a highly convenient
tool – so many use cases right at my fingertips with dependable results in
seconds. It saves me a ton of time by allowing me to streamline my work. I’m a Digital
Marketer with a specialty in Content Marketing and SEO. I cover the entire
content process from ideation to distribution. ChatGPT helps me in almost all
aspects of the journey.

I use it for:



· Research

· Strategy

· Content
ideation

· Content
writing

· Content
editing

· Content
analysis

· Image
generation

· Audio
and video transcription

· Data
analysis and mining

· Keyword
research. Marketing is a diverse field with numerous components. The content aspect of it is
notoriously tedious and resource-laden. ChatGPT addresses these significant challenges by saving substantial time and resources, while also enhancing production and improving quality.

##### [Pros](https://www.trustradius.com/products/chatgpt/reviews?qs=pros-and-cons\#reviews)

- Excellent research tool.

- Great strategic partner.

- Very good writer.

- Image generator is solid.


##### Cons

- Hallucinations still has room for improvements.

- Image generator has room for improvements.

- Writing has room for improvements - it can be more human and sound less robotic.


##### [Likelihood to Recommend](https://www.trustradius.com/products/chatgpt/reviews?qs=likelihood-to-recommend\#reviews)

Well-suited for: Research, strategy, generating content ideas, and analysis. Less appropriate: - For writing world-class human-centric articles - Generating accurate, realistic images - Personal advice.

3 years of experience

##### [Use Cases and Deployment Scope](https://www.trustradius.com/products/chatgpt/reviews?qs=product-usage\#reviews)

I use ChatGPT constantly as a Consultant and Project Manager in my client and personal business work for preliminary research, writing purposes (such as emails, one pagers, white papers, etc.), I have it outline templates, tables, and programs for me, and my favorite function is using it for setting up Excel and Google sheets formulas and spreadsheets, including Google Scripts.

##### [Pros](https://www.trustradius.com/products/chatgpt/reviews?qs=pros-and-cons\#reviews)

- Creating spreadsheet formulas and set-up instructions (ie. Apps Scripts and Macros)

- Brainstorming ideas and lists of questions to ask yourself and others (ie. In meetings and interviews, when developing a business plan, etc.)

- Writing emails


##### Cons

- Statistical figures are often wrong and ill-cited. For example, for a presentation, I was trying to cite statistics and comparisons as to how rare one event is versus another, and I got different outputs every time. These answers were not reliable.

- I can never trust ChatGPT math. Even simple equations are sometimes miscalculated, and when dealing with large numbers, small errors or rounding discrepancies result in wildly inaccurate figures.

- Unorganized/inaccurate sources. When I ask ChatGPT to cite sources, it doesn’t cleanly quote where it got each point from. And if you read the cited article, the figure/info it provides might differ from ChatGPT’s output.


##### [Likelihood to Recommend](https://www.trustradius.com/products/chatgpt/reviews?qs=likelihood-to-recommend\#reviews)

I’d definitely recommend ChatGPT to anyone as a great introduction to generative AI and as a starting point in research, writing, brainstorming, or general questions or judgement questions. It can be a great tool to use when you don’t necessarily need an accurate answer. For example, I wouldn’t let it calculate my taxes, but I’d use it to ask some general tax questions, then ask for sources and then verify by checking those sources. I also love ChatGPT for writing and questions - it’s great for emails, creating templates and outlines, and for generating spreadsheet formulas.
