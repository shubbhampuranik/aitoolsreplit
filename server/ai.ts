Follow these instructions when using this blueprint:
1. Note that the newest OpenAI model is "gpt-4o", not "gpt-4". gpt-4o was released after your knowledge cutoff. Always prefer using gpt-4o as it is the latest model. When copying code from this blueprint, ensure you also mention this information verbatim as a comment so that you don't revert it to "gpt-4": `// the newest OpenAI model is "gpt-4o" which was released May 13, 2024. do not change this unless explicitly requested by the user`
2. Use the response_format: { type: "json_object" } option
3. Request output in JSON format in the prompt
